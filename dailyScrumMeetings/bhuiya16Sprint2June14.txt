What did I do last time?
	- Completed command interpreter error checking
	- Worked with team to distribute tasks for Sprint 2
	- Fixed some methods in shell and session class to work with command interpreter

What do I plan to do now?
	- Implement directory stack
	- Make changes to command interpreter
	- Fix CRC Cards, Sprint 2 logs

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Possibly, depends on if implementation of other functions are broken
