What did I do last time?
	- Created product backlog with team members
	- Helped decide which CRC cards to use

What do I plan to do now?
	- Work on initializing the shell with the session class
	- Work on getting the shell to exit

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Haven't run in to any issues yet, still early in the process.
