What did I do last time?
	- Created the product backlog with teammates
	- Started editing CRC cards for command interpreter and others

What do I plan to do now?
	- Work on the output and processing input from console
	- Start working on the implemention of the command interpreter

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not anything at the moment, it's too early
