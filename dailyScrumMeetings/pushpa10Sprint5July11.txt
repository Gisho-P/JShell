What did I do last time?
    - Fixed errors in list directory contents after a design change with output
    - Wrote tests for the recursive ls option

What do I plan to do now?
   - Add tests for the display file
   - Add tests for output redirection

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Still some errors that need to be fixed from the design change.
