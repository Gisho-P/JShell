What did I do last time?
	- Finalize CRC Cards/ Shell class system
	- Communicate changes to team so they know how to work their code

What do I plan to do now?
	- Start working on beginning implementation of Shell
	- Complete Command Interpreter

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not anything at the moment, it's too early
