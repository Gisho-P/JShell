What did I do last time?
    - Planned design for the second part of the JShell assignment.
    - Implemented the Output class which handles output redirection
    - Planned implementation of new commands and the changes to the old commands

What do I plan to do now?
   - Re factor list directory contents to work with sub directories
   - Add tests for recursive option

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Nothing right now.
