What did I do last time?
    - Added Equals method in the directory class
    - Updated MySession class. Modified so it saves the root directory node.
    - Started working on the pwd and mkdir command methods

What do I plan to do now?
    -Fix bugs in the mkdir and pwd commands
    -Also create tests for the mkdir and pwd commands
    -Might have to change the design to use HashTable to determine what command was entered

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need to verify the mkdir and pwd command methods are compatible with the FilePathInterpreter. Might need to add input checking to the mkdir 	function
