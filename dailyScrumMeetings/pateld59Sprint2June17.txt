What did I do last time?
    - Replanned the design of the commands to make it more convenient. Now the commands class will contain all of the commands.
    - Fixed bugs in directory and file class
    - Create tests for directory and file class

What do I plan to do now?
    -Need to implement the mkdir command
    -Also create tests for the mkdir command

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need to wait for a bug in the filepathinterpreter to be fixed before I can start working on the mkdir command
