What did I do last time?
   - Fixed case where mv is used to rename files or directories
   - Fixed bug in setName and getParent methods of the Directory class

What do I plan to do now?
   - Add tests for mv and cp
   - Make changes to directory so it uses singleton design for the root
   - Make mv command collaborate with cp to remove duplicate code

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need to clarify the output redirection. When are commands supposed to ignore output redirection. When the stdout is empty?
