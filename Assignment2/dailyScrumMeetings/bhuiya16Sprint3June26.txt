What did I do last time?
    - Removed debug statements, fixed error and regex statements
	- Created Command Interface, that each command class implements
	- Deleted ShellFunctions and CommandInterpreter classes
	- Do processing and execution in JShell, used reflection to do so
	- Formatting and documentation
	- Added tests
What do I plan to do now?
    - Add tests
	- Complete documentation
	- Submit
	- Meeting with team members to discuss final things

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Not necessarily, dependant on test failures
