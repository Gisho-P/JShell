What did I do last time?
    - Fixed bugs in mkdir and pwd commands

What do I plan to do now?
    - Create tests for the edge cases in the cd and mkdir commands
    - Fix any bugs discovered by testing

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Mkdir relies entirely on FilePathInterpreter which still has some issues. Still need to wait for the bugs in the FilePathInterpreter to be fixed
