What did I do last time?
   - Implemented the curl command. Added copy methods to File and Directory classes for the mv and cp commands

What do I plan to do now?
   - Need to deal with edge cases of the curl command. Change the output to deal with stderr and stdout.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need to ask instructor about edge cases of the curl command
