What did I do last time?
    - Created the directory class with functionality which allows users to add contents, remove contents and list contents
    - Created the file class with functionality which allows users to overwrite or concatenate to contents

What do I plan to do now?
    - Implement the pwd, ls and mkdir commands
    - Create tests for directory and file class

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need to wait for FilePathInterpreter bugs to be fixed in order to start working on the commands
