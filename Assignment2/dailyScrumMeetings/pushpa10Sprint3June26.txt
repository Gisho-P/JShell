What did I do last time?
	- Updated commands to reflect new design with abstract class
	- Fixed bugs in ls and echo

What do I plan to do now?
	- Write tests for a combination of commands, including ls and echo
	- Add Documentation to remaining parts of the code

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Nothing, we are pretty much done just touch ups now.
