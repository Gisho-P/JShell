What did I do last time?
    - Implemented the FilePathInterpreterClass
    - Changed how session prints of all commands

What do I plan to do now?
    - Implement cat and cd command
    - Create tests for FilePathInterpreter

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need to create the general command class before creating them
