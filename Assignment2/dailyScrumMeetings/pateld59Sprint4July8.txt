What did I do last time?
   - Fixed edge cases for the curl command. Fixed bugs related to mv and cp

What do I plan to do now?
   - Create tests for the curl command and update the documentation. There are still bugs in the
     cp and mv command that need to be fixed.

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need to ask questions to clarify certain functions of the cp and mv command
