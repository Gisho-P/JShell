What did I do last time?
    - Set everything to new output scructure
	- Reorganized JShell to complete command before redirection
	- Continued on !NUMBER command
	
What do I plan to do now?
    - Maintain, add to new structure
	- Comments, documentation, CRC Card
	- Finish !
	- Clean up
	
Am I blocked on anything?
    - Not necessarily, dependant on test failures
