What did I do last time?
    - Planned design for the second part of the JShell assignment.
    - Created product backlog
    - Planned implementation of new commands and the changes to the old commands

What do I plan to do now?
   - Create the RetrieveUrlFile class for the curl command
   - Add copy methods to File and Directory classes for mv and cp commands

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Need to wait for outputs of commands to be categorized in stderr and stdout
