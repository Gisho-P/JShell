User Stories from Product Backlog that we will address in this sprint:
a) As a user, I can create a directory that I can go through and create files in.
b) As a user, I can traverse through directories to look for/create/delete files, etc.
c) As a user, I can display the contents of the directory I'm currently on.
d) As a user, I can keep track of what directory I'm in by displaying it's path.
e) As a user, I can save my current directory for use later and go to a new directory.
f) As a user, I can retrieve a previously saved directory and go back to it.
g) As a user, I can look at the history of commands I entered in the shell.
h) As a user, I can choose a file and look at it's contents.
i) As a user, I can display text in the shell.
j) As a user, I can take written text and save it in a file for later use.
k) As a user, I can take a file, append content to it and save it.
l) As a user, I can display the manual to a command I don't understand.
